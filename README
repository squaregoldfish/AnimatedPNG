CREATE AN ANIMATION
-------------------
In its most simple form, an animation can be created using just two
lines of code. To create a ten-frame animation using the images fish01.png
through fish10.png, with 100ms between each frame, use the following code:

fishAnim = new AnimatedPNG('anim', 'fish01.png', 10, 100);
fishAnim.draw();


ANIMATION BEHAVIOUR
-------------------
To alter the behaviour of an animation, use the following functions:


setRepeat(repeatFlag);
    Specifies whether or not the animation will repeat when it completes.

setFrameDelay(frame, delay);
    Sets the delay for an individual frame of the animation.

startAnimation();
    Restarts the animation if it has been stopped.

stopAnimation();
    Stops the animation on the current frame.
